Tips for Project 1

Export jidt code into Python, Matlab or Java, Create enough data to fill discrete valeus with enough samples to estimate probabilities:

	100 data points and 10 discrete values or 10000 data points and 100 discrete values

	You can also experiment with jernel estimators (if you want to) for part 4

	To measure top down TE to 3 subpopulations -- calculate TE individually to each of the 3 subp...
		afterwards average all 30 (10x3) together for the Figure showing TE.
